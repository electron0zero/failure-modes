On October 28, 2021, Roblox experienced a 73-hour complete platform outage affecting over 50 million daily users. The incident was caused by infrastructure complexity issues during routine system operations, with tightly coupled services, database constraints, and cascading failures preventing recovery.

The outage impacted the entire gaming ecosystem - players couldn't access games, developers lost revenue, and virtual currency transactions were frozen. Recovery was complicated by the need to restore services in specific sequences while maintaining data consistency across the platform's complex architecture.
