On July 19, 2022, the UK experienced record-breaking temperatures reaching 40.3°C (104.5°F) for the first time in history. This extreme heat caused two cooling units at Oracle Cloud's UK South region to fail when operating above their design limits, resulting in protective equipment shutdowns that lasted approximately 19 hours.

The incident highlighted the growing intersection between climate change and digital infrastructure reliability, demonstrating how infrastructure designed for historical climate conditions can fail during extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent.
