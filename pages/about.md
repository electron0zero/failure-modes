## What is Failure Modes?

Failure Modes is a community of software practitioners that likes to share and discuss the failure modes they have seen in production systems.

We host meetups in Bangalore, India.

Meetups are invite-only and follow [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) to ensure a safe space to share failures. 

> **Chatham House Rule:** When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule,
> participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of
> the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

See the [meetup](/meetup/) page for more details about the meetup.

Browse around this website and explore the collection of incidents and [learn](/learn/) from literature 
on how and why software systems fail, and how we can build better systems

## Why Failure Modes?

Running software systems in production is hard, and running distributed systems in production is even harder.

Failure Modes is an effort to curate resources and stories from the community,
to learn and get better at running large scale software in production.
