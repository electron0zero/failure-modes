## Failure Modes Meetup - Pune

The Pune Chapter of Failure Modes Meetup is an officially recognized local extension of the Failure Modes community.

It exists to facilitate highâ€‘trust conversations around failure and resilience in software systems,
aligned with the failuremodes community.

Pune Chapter of failuremodes meetup is run by [Chinmay Naik](https://in.linkedin.com/in/chinmay185), [Srivatsa RV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srivatsarv/) and [Pranay Narang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranay-narang/)

We also have meetups in [Bangalore](/meetup/), India.

We meet whenever the organizers have time to manage the logistics of the meetup and have a venue that can host us. :smile:

Meetups are invite-only and follow [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) to ensure a safe space to share failures.
